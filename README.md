# rfpdr

This repository contains datasets files and scripts generated by Sim√≥n, Borsani & Filippi.

The R scripts require minimum custom settings (i.e.; install needed packages, set the working directory, choose between "FD" or "RD" models). 
To build the model, running order is: (1) featext.r, (2) training.r, (3) metrics.r
For predictions, use rfpdr.r

For any request, please contact dsimon@fcien.edu.uy and cfilippi@fagro.edu.uy.
